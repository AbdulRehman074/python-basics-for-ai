# ðŸ“™ Day 3 â€” Sum and Average Calculator

### ðŸ”¹ Project: Sum and Average Calculator

A Python program that takes 5 numbers from the user and calculates both the **total sum** and **average**.

**Concepts Covered:**
- For Loops (`for i in range()`)
- While Loops for Input Validation
- Type Casting (`float()`)
- Error Handling using `try` and `except`

**Example Output:**
Enter number 1 of 5: 10
Enter number 2 of 5: 20
Enter number 3 of 5: 30
Enter number 4 of 5: 40
Enter number 5 of 5: 50

--- Results ---
The Total Sum is: 150.00
The Average is: 30.00


ðŸ§© **Goal:** Practice loops and error handling while performing simple arithmetic.
