# ðŸ§  Day 3 â€” Daily Study Tracker

This Python program lets users record their daily study activity.  
It demonstrates:
- Function structure (`input_collection`, `validate_hours`, etc.)
- Input validation
- Looping and summary creation

## How it Works
1. Prompts for your name, study hours, and favorite topic.
2. Validates hours (must be non-negative).
3. Prints a study summary.
4. Optionally allows multiple entries in one run.
